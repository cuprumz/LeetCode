### Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

### Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash table

### More Knowledge

- Binary search
- Bitwise operations

### Trees

- Trees - 
  - basic tree construction
  - traversal
  - manipulation algorithms
  - breadth-first search
  - depth-first search
- Binary search trees: BSTs
- Heap / Priority Queue / Binary Heap

### Sorting

- best case/worst case, average complexity
- stability in sorting algorithms
- Wouldn't recommend sorting a linked list, but merge sort is doable.
- merge sort
- quick sort
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- radix sort

### Graphs

- Represent a graph in memory: objects and pointers; adjacency matrix; adjacency list; adjacency map
- Single-Source Shortest Paths Problem
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford

### Even More Knowledge

- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Combinatorics (n choose k) & Probability
- NP, NP-Complete and Approximation Algorithms
